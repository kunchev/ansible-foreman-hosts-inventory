# ansible-foreman-hosts-inventory
Query the Foreman API and parse all host groups in the desired
environment with their host members, generate Ansible inventory file
using the parsed data and specific Ansible hosts file format.

 - Parse the Foreman API and print all environments with their respective IDs
 - Parse the Foreman API per environment and generate Ansible hosts file containing host group and hosts related
 - Cron job can be set to automatically generate recent hosts file
 - Requires network connection from the source machine to the Foreman server
 - Requires some additional modules to be installed (check the requirements.txt file)
 - Runs on Windows and NIX* operating systems with Python 3.x installed

# included modules and configs
 - modules/frmn_configparser.py - Parse required settings in order proper API requests to be initiated
 - modules/frmn_envparser.py - Initiate API calls to the Foreman API endpoint(s) and parse/generate the data
 - config/foreman.ini - API connection details (API endpoint URL, API user, API password, output file name)

# example generated file
Each host group in selected Foreman environment is represented in the file below in square brackets with all servers contained  
*lets open example file, generated by the script from a test Foreman instance*
```
 - vim ./foreman_hosts
 - nano ./foreman_hosts
 - cat ./foreman_hosts
 - less ./foreman_hosts
 # or use any other method to list the contents of the file which is suitable to your operating system

This inventory file can be passed to Ansible and be to be used as a hosts file
```
Use Ansible 'raw' module to execute the 'uptime' command on all servers in the 'test/DB' hostgroup
ansible -m raw -a "uptime" -i /path/to/foreman_inventory test/DB

Use Ansible 'raw' module to execute the 'hostname -s' command on all servers in the 'mailservers' and 'backupservers' hostgroups
ansible -m raw -a "hostname -s" /path/to/foreman_inventory mailservers:backupservers

</path/to/foreman_inventory> is the path to the Ansible inventory file generated by the script
```
Any other Ansible module can be used as well as playbook or role, all you need to do is point the path to the 'foreman_hosts' file and specify the desired host group(s), or simply set 'all' to run on all host groups in the file
